# Quantum Signal Research
This repository serves as an active record of my effort to test the ability to find trading signals in quantum computing focused companies. I hypothesize that a correlation between publications from a companies reserach team on their system has a positive affect on the companies share price. 

This repository will evolve over time. At this stage, however, it will mainly consist of python helper functions, and juptyer notebooks walking through small case examples, testing my hypothesis. If you see anything in this work that you think could be improved, or have ideas on other potential signals, please feel free to reach out to me to collaborate.
